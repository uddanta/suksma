20121216: *Started logging of changes. Removed "; cd .." from make file.
20130101: *Tried to reactivate TOSHIBA_SMM in vesa.c - seems to do no harm.
20130104: *Added/tested SCREENSAVER as possible flag +/-5K
		  *Added/tested SERVER_LOCK as possible flag +/-2K
		  *Moved SMART_SCHEDULE to be a choice	+/-2K
		  *Added/tested USE_RGB_TXT as possible flag...compiles...
		  *Added/tested XCMISC as possible flag +/-2K (not removed from
		  *Xext/makefile yet) TODO! 	+/-1K
		  *Added/tested XDMCP as possible flag - this spawns error: 
		  undefined reference to XdmcpDisposeARRAY8, XdmcpARRAY8Equal,
		  XdmcpDisposeARRAY16 etc - from xdmcp.c - healed by adding 
		  -lXdmcp +/-10K
		  *Added/tested XTRAP as possible flag
		  *Added/tested XV as possible flag
		  *Added/tested XKB_IN_SERVER as possible flag...compiles...
		  *Added/tested RANDR as possible flag...compiles...
		
		  *Added/tested XINPUT as possible flag - errors out:
		  Xext/xtest.c missing XI.h & XIproto.h. tried to add them in
		  include and this gives missing Xproto.h & X.h - adding them
		  as well - but this results in failure at linking ex.
		  undefined reference to MaybeSendDeviceMotionNotifyHint...
		  SO NEED SOME WORK/EXTERNAL LIB
		
		  *Added/tested XKB as possible flag: dix/devices.c gives
		  missing XKBsrv.h so adding that - gives missing XKBstr.h &
		  XKBproto.h - now missing XKB.h - then missing Xmd.h - and
		  then linking errors ex. undefined reference to
		  XkbFreeInfo...SO NEED SOME WORK/EXTERNAL LIB
		
		  *Added/tested XRECORD as possible flag...gives link error
		  from mi/miinitext.c undefined reference to
		  RecordExtensionInit. So added lib record from xorg 1.2.0
		  and added needed makefile changes (including link with
		  -lXinerama) but still link error (missing 
		  XineramaGetCursorScreen) added that to dix/events.c from 
		  xorg1.2.0...compiles
		  
		  *Now the build has 13 extensions: 
		  DEC-XTRAP, DPMS, MIT-SCREEN-SAVER, MIT-SHM, RANDR, RECORD,
		  RENDER, SHAPE, SYNC, TOG-CUP, XC-MISC, XTEST, XVideo
		  so for now it seems that the source is used the outmost 
		  possible...(?)
		
20130204: Fix some bitrot/portability issues.
		*Use uid_t and gid_t instead of assuming the implementation
		exploits its private namespace. (For musl)
		*Change IF_MASK and IOPL_MASK to the equivalents in the
		current <sys/vm86.h>
		*Change configuration for my site.

		    hw/kdrive/kinput.c+hw/kdrive/linux/linux.c added FNDELAY for
		    dietlibc builds.
		    *Trying to get fontserver working (for abiword to work) - 
		    revising -DNOFONTSERVERACCESS \\ from standard_definitions.mk.
		    Adding -DFONTCACHE \\ to standard_definitions.mk. The extension
		    is now reported but abiword still wont work.
		    *changed XKB_IN_SERVER=-DXKB_IN_SERVER to XKB_IN_SERVER=-DXKB
		    in standard_definitions.mk. and deactivated as XKB does not compile.
		    *removed some warnings dix/dispatch, dix/events.c, os/connection.c
		    and hw/kdrive/vesa/vbe.c
		    *revised os/Makefile to respect settings in standard_definitions.mk
		    *revised Xext/Makefile to respect settings in 
		    standard_definitions.mk
